If the beast is intelligent and understands language, the spell fails. Until the spell ends, the link is active while you and the beast are within the spell range of each other. Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you. While the link is active, the beast gains advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.", "TimeToCast": "Action", "Concentration": "Y", "Range": "10 yards", "DamageEffect": "Beast Telepathy", "Target": "*1 friendly Animals within range","PossibleEnhancements":["Range" ,"MultiTarget"],"owner_modified":{""Range"":0,""MultiTarget"":0}, "Move": "Automatic"}
