Sorcery does not imply literacy if you come from a barbarian place, though but does imply you know the names of spirits and demons, and the use of dreadful potions and words, and you can sense sorcery. Sorcery involves dealing with dark powers.\nYou get to learn 1 magical language per level (from the list of languages, but only magical ones).\nMagicians are both respected and feared. There are few who will deal with them willingly without great need, as a great many magicians are amoral at best, exceedingly evil at worst, and all of them are at least slightly unhinged. Magicians often live alone, with only a few servants or the occasional apprentice to attend them.</p></div>"},"weapons":[],"feats":["Area_of_Magic","Area_of_Magic2","Area_of_Magic3","Magic_Reserve","Wisdom","Taboo"],"languages":[["Abyssal (magic)","Arachnos (Magic) ","BeastSpeech (Magic)","Celestial (Magic)","Firespeech (Magic)","High Elvish (Magic)","Ignos (Firespeech) (Magic)","Sea Tongue (Magic) ","Saurian (Magic) ","Windsong (Magic)"]],"tools":"Magical Devices","mana":1,"owner_level":"3","owner_careerPointsSpent":0,"owner_featsChosen":{"Area_of_Magic":true,"Area_of_Magic2":true,"Magic_Reserve":true},"source":"GilPTBA"}}
