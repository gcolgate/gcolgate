They are adept at sneak attacks, killing, information gathering, disguises, city lore, persuasion, poisons, and lock picking. Their methods involve gathering intelligence on their subject from various (sometimes seedy) sources, circumventing security measures of all types, adopting disguises that allow them to get close to the target, and building up a broad selection of contacts. They are also patient, sometimes hiding out in a single spot for days to await the perfect opportunity to strike. </p></div>"},"weapons":["Ambush","Simple","AllMartial"],"feats":["Holdout_Weapon","Wicked_Lie","Anatomy","Poison_Master","Sniper","Disguise_Master","Master_of_Stealth"],"languages":[],"tools":"By Feat","owner_level":0,"owner_careerPointsSpent":0,"owner_featsChosen":{},"source":"GilPTBA"}}
