They train animals for riding, for pulling wagons, for combat, and even for the gladiatorial arena. Beastmasters can calm maddened creatures, are expert riders and wagoneers, can recognize whether creatures are dangerous and about to attack or not, and often have some skill in healing them if injured or sick. Some beastmasters rule their animals by fear and deprivation.</p></div>"},"weapons":[],"feats":["Animal_Companion","Swift_Rider","Animal_Influence","Animal_Communication","Commune"],"languages":[],"tools":"Animals","owner_level":2,"owner_careerPointsSpent":0,"owner_featsChosen":[],"source":"GilPTBA"}}
