Once hunters locate their target, theyâ€™ll use stealth, traps and/or expert bowmanship or spears  to bring it down. They are at home in the wild and can survive there for long periods, returning to more civilized areas only when they have furs and hides to sell, or when they require the company of their fellow men (or women). </p></div>"},"weapons":["Ranged"],"feats":["Home_Field_Advantage","Sniper","Pack_Rat","Master_of_Stealth","Commune","Climber"],"languages":[],"tools":"Animals, Animal Traps,Camping, Tracking","owner_level":3,"owner_careerPointsSpent":0,"owner_featsChosen":{"Sniper":true,"Pack_Rat":false,"Master_of_Stealth":true,"Climber":true,"Home_Field_Advantage":false},"source":"GilPTBA"}}
